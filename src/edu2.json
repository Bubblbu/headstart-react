The vast majority of the current literature in this new research area consists of case studies. Communities of practice have the following components that distinguish them from traditional organizations and learning situations: (1) different levels of expertise that are simultaneously present in the community of practice; (2) fluid peripheral to center movement that symbolizes the progression from being a novice to an expert; and (3) completely authentic tasks and communication. Supporting concepts include aspects of constructivism (i.e., ill-structured problems, facilitation, collaborative learning, and negotiated goals), community knowledge greater than individual knowledge, as well as an environment of safety and trust. Virtual communities are defined as designed communities using current networked technology, whereas communities of practice emerge within the designed community via the ways their participants use the designed community. Current networked technology has both advantages and disadvantages in emergent development of communities of practice. Because most collaboration is text-based, norms are reduced, enabling introverted participants to share their ideas on an equal footing with extroverts. However, the greatest problem with virtual communities is withdrawing, or attrition. This problem can be reduced somewhat through good facilitation techniques and adequate scaffolding, especially in the cases of online communication techniques and technical support. Finally, the author recommends further research questions and proposes a case study, whose purpose is to observe the effects of an emerging community of practice within the designed environment of a virtual community.", "paper_abstract": "Community of Practice", "y": "2.3622324177010157", "x": "156"}, {"file_hash": "a-theory-of-online-learning-as-online-participation", "year": "Computers & Education", "id": "adae2ec0-6d02-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7", "authos": "70008455a87e20764ea07c5d6698798084ea3943", "title": "A theory of online learning as online participation", "url": "2009", "area": "1.7251241459945046", "published_in": "In this paper, an initial theory of online learning as online participation is suggested.

Learning sciences researchers investigate cognition in context, at times emphasizing one more than the other but with the broad goal of developing evidence-based claims derived from both laboratory-based and naturalistic investigations that result in knowledge about how people learn. This work can involve the development of technological tools, curriculum, and especially theory that can be used to understand and support learning. A fundamental assumption of many learning scientists is that cognition is not a thing located within the individual thinker but is a process that is distributed across the knower, the environment in which knowing occurs, and the activity in which the learner participates. In other words, learning, cognition, knowing, and context are irreducibly co-constituted and cannot be treated as isolated entities or processes. If one believes that context matters in terms of learning and cognition, research paradigms that simply examine these processes as isolated variables within laboratory or other impoverished contexts of participation will necessarily lead to an incomplete understanding of their relevance in more naturalistic settings (Brown, 1992).1 Alternatively, simply observing learning and cognition as they naturally THE JOURNAL OF THE LEARNING SCIENCES, 13(1), 114 Copyright 2004, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.

Education is an applied field, and learning scientists bring agendas to their work, seeking to produce specific results such as engaging students in the making of science, creating online communities for professional development, or creating history classrooms that confront students preexisting beliefs about race, gender, or class. As such, learning scientists have found that they must develop technological tools, curriculum, and especially theories that help them systematically understand and predict how learning occurs. Such design research offers several benefits: research results that consider the role of social context and have better potential for influencing educational practice, tangible products, and programs that can be adopted elsewhere; and research results that are validated through the consequences of their use, providing consequential evidence or validity (Messick, 1992). However, participating in local educational practices places researchers in the role of curriculum designers, and implicitly, curriculum theorists who are directly positioned in social and political contexts of educational practice (both global and local) and who are accountable for the social and political consequences of their research programs. Increasingly, learning scientists are finding themselves developing contexts, frameworks, tools and pedagogical models consistent with and to better understand emerging pedagogical theories or ontological commitments (see diSessa & Cobb, this issue). In these contexts, the research moves beyond simply observing and actually involves systematically engineering these contexts in ways that allow us to improve and generate evidence-based claims about learning. The commitment to examining learning in naturalistic contexts, many of which are designed and systematically changed by the researcher, necessitates the development of a methodological toolkit for deriving evidence-based claims from these contexts. One such methodology that has grown in application is that of design experimentation or design-based research, frequently traced back to the work of Ann Brown (1992) and Alan Collins (1992). Design-based research is not so much an approach as it is a series of approaches, with the intent of producing new theories, artifacts, and practices that account for and potentially impact learning and teaching in naturalistic settings. Cobb, diSessa, Lehrer, & Schauble (2003) stated: Prototypically, design experiments entail both engineering particular forms of learning and systematically studying those forms of learning within the context defined by the means of supporting them. This designed context is subject to test and revision, and the successive iterations that result play a role similar to that of systematic variation in experiment. (p. 9) They further suggested that design-based research has a number of common features, including the fact that they result in the production of theories on learning and teaching, are interventionist (involving some sort of design), take place in naturalistic contexts, and are iterative. Design-based research is not simply a type of formative evaluation that allows learning scientists to better understand the ecological validity of theoretical claims generated in the laboratory. Design-based research, as conceived by Ann Brown (1992), was introduced with the expectation that researchers would systemically adjust various aspects of the designed context so that each adjustment served as a type of experimentation that allowed the researchers to test and generate theory in naturalistic contexts. Although design-based research has the potential to offer a useful methodological toolkit to those researchers committed to understanding variables within naturalistic contexts, there are many unresolved questions that we as a community must address if our assertions are going to be deemed credible and trustworthy to others. Some questions are: What are the core foci of design-based research and what delineates it from other forms of research? What counts as reasonable and useful warrants for advancing assertions investigated through this type of research? What are the boundaries of a naturalistic context? How do we control researcher bias in selecting evidence, in reporting observations, and in developing trustworthy claims? How do we understand the contextuality of reserach claims generated in situ and use them to inform broader practice? In the following, we begin the process of responding to these questions, a process that is taken up in greater detail through the core articles and commentaries that comprise this special issue and that we hope will be taken up over the next decade by our colleagues.", "paper_abstract": "Design-based Research", "y": "2.974797613760556", "x": "110"}, {"file_hash": "design-experiments-in-educational-research", "year": "Educational Researcher", "id": "683b2b60-6d00-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7", "authos": "12b16d65d3fbf45737d7bc3e9ef6516185fce577", "title": "Design Experiments in Educational Research", "url": "2003", "area": "1.6991670151202405", "published_in": "In this article, the authors first indicate the range of purposes and the variety of settings in which design experiments have been con- ducted and then delineate five crosscutting features that collectively differentiate design experiments from other methodologies.

Specifically, the transformative and integrative views are juxtaposed for exploring the epistemology of TPCK, and, at the end, the transformative view is adopted concluding that TPCK is a unique body of knowledge that is constructed from the interaction of its individual contributing knowledge bases. Then, ICT&x2013;TPCK is introduced as a strand of TPCK, and is described as the ways knowledge about tools and their affordances, pedagogy, content, learners, and context are synthesized into an understanding of how particular topics that are difficult to be understood by learners or difficult to be represented by teachers can be transformed and taught more effectively with technology in ways that signify its added value. One model for the development and another for the assessment of ICT&x2013;TPCK are then discussed. Technology Mapping is proposed as a situative methodology for the development of ICT&x2013;TPCK, and three forms of assessment, namely, expert assessment, peer assessment, and self-assessment are proposed for assessing teachers&x2019; competencies to teach with technology. The paper also reports on the empirical findings of a study that was undertaken to investigate the impact of the proposed models on student learning within the context of two design tasks in a pre-service primary teacher education course.

People in general, not just a specialized elite, need to work creatively with knowledge. As Peter Drucker put it Innovation must be part and parcel of the ordinary, the norm, if not routine. This presents a formidable new challenge: how to develop citizens who not only possess up-to-date knowledge but are able to participate in the creation of new knowledge as a normal part of their lives. There are no proven methods of educating people to be producers of knowledge. Knowledge creators of the past have been too few and too exceptional in their talents to provide much basis for educational planning. In the absence of pedagogical theory, learning-by-doing and apprenticeship are the methods of choice; but this does not seem feasible if the doing in question is the making of original discoveries, inventions, and plans. Rather, we must think of a developmental trajectory leading from the natural inquisitiveness of the young child to the disciplined creativity of the mature knowledge producer. The challenge, then, will be to get students on to that trajectory. But what is the nature of this trajectory and of movement along it? There are three time-honored answers that provide partial solutions at best. One approach emphasizes foundational knowledge: First master what is already known. In practice this means that knowledge creation does not enter the picture until graduate school or adult work, by which time the vast majority of people are unprepared for the challenge. A second approach focuses on subskills: Master component skills such as critical thinking, scientific method, and collaboration; later, assemble these into competent original research, design, and so forth. Again, the assemblyif it occurs at alltypically occurs only at advanced levels that are reached by only a few. Additionally, the core motivationadvancing the frontiers of knowledgeis missing, with the result that the component skills are pursued as ends in themselves, lacking in authentic purpose. Subskill approaches remain popular (now often under the banner of twenty-first century skills) because they lend themselves to parsing the curriculum into specific objectives. A third approach is associated with such labels as learning communities, project-based learning, and guided discovery. Knowledge is socially constructed, and best supported through collaborations designed so that participants share knowledge and tackle projects that incorporate features of adult teamwork, real-world content, and use of varied information sources. This is the most widely supported approach at present, especially with regard to the use of information technology.

Specifically, we examined the effect of each technique on student performance on low-order and high-order questions related to each body system as well as the student-perceived value of each technique. Students who modeled anatomic structures in clay scored significantly higher on low-order questions related to peripheral nerves; scores were comparable between groups for high-order questions on peripheral nerves and for questions on muscles and blood vessels. Likert-scale surveys were used to measure student responses to statements about each laboratory technique. A significantly greater percentage of students in the clay modeling group 'agreed' or 'strongly agreed' with positive statements about their respective technique. These results indicate that clay modeling and cat dissection are equally effective in achieving student learning outcomes for certain systems in undergraduate human anatomy.

The article draws on evidence from a survey of first year undergraduates studying a range of pure and applied subjects. Overall we found a complex picture amongst first-year students with the sample population appearing to be a collection of minorities. These included a small minority that made little use of some technologies and larger minorities that made extensive use of new technologies. Often the use of new technology was in ways that did not fully correspond with the expectations that arise from the Net generation and Digital Natives theses. The article concludes that whilst there are strong age related variations amongst the sample it is far to simplistic to describe young first-year students born after 1983 as a single generation.

In contrast to recent efforts to seek a singular definition for design experimentation, I argue that methodological and epistemological issues are significantly more tractable if considered from the perspective of manifold families of theoretically framed design-based research. After characterizing a range of such families, I suggest that, as we deliberate on the nature of design-based research, greater attention should be given to the pluralistic nature of learning theory, to the relation between theory and method, and to working across theoretical and methodological boundaries through the use of mixed methods.

This is not so much a technical question as an educational one, although changing technologies are key drivers in educational change. The paper starts by looking at the changing face of education and goes on to consider the different ways in which the so-called net generation is using technology for learning. It goes on to consider some of the pressures for change in the present education systems. The idea of a Personal Learning Environment recognises that learning is ongoing and seeks to provide tools to support that learning. It also recognises the role of the individual in organising his or her own learning. Moreover, the pressures for a PLE are based on the idea that learning will take place in different contexts and situations and will not be provided by a single learning provider. Linked to this is an increasing recognition of the importance of informal learning. The paper also looks at changing technology, especially the emergence of ubiquitous computing and the development of social software. The paper believes that we are coming to realise that we cannot simply reproduce previous forms of learning, the classroom or the university, embodied in software. Instead, we have to look at the new opportunities for learning afforded by emerging technologies. Social software offers the opportunity to narrow the divide between producers and consumers. Consumers themselves become producers, through creating and sharing. One implication is the potential for a new ecology of open content, books, learning materials and multimedia, through learners themselves becoming producers of learning materials. Social software has already led to the widespread adoption of portfolios for learners, bringing together learning from different contexts and sources of learning and providing an ongoing record of lifelong learning, capable of expression in different forms.

In this article, we first demonstrate that Kirschner et al. have mistakenly conflated PBL and IL with discovery learning. We then present evidence demonstrating that PBL and IL are powerful and effective models of learning. Far from being contrary to many of the principles of guided learning that Kirschner et al. discussed, both PBL and IL employ scaffolding extensively thereby reducing the cognitive load and allowing students to learn in complex domains. Moreover, these approaches to learning address important goals of education that include content knowledge, epistemic practices, and soft skills such as collaboration and self-directed learning.", "paper_abstract": "Cognitive Models", "y": "2.615678802664171", "x": "178"}, {"file_hash": "scientific-habits-of-mind-in-virtual-worlds", "year": "Journal of Science Education and Technology", "id": "9f49fd40-6d03-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7", "authos": "4667f9d5a7b67bb6f71f5eba900308a2039c2999", "title": "Scientific Habits of Mind in Virtual Worlds", "url": "2008", "area": "1.1984603305148303", "published_in": "In todays increasingly flat world of global- ization (Friedman 2005), the need for a scientifically literate citizenry has grown more urgent.

It attempts to capture some of the essential qualities of teacher knowledge required for technology integration in teaching, while addressing the complex, multifaceted, and situated nature of this knowledge. We argue, briefly, that thoughtful pedagogical uses of technology require the development of a complex,situated form of knowledge that we call Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPCK). In doing so, we posit the complex roles of, and interplay among, three main components of learning environments: content, pedagogy, and technology. We argue that this model has much to offer to discussions of technology integration at multiple levels: theoretical, pedagogical, and methodological.

Podcasting involves downloading a series of audio or video broadcasts (files) onto a digital media player, via a computer, over a period of weeks. These can then be watched or listened to when, where and as often as students choose. The use of digital media players, popularised by Apple's iPod(TM), is widespread amongst undergraduate students. A pilot survey of Business and Management students indicated that over 74% owned some form of digital media player, with a further 7% indicating that they intended to purchase one in the next six months. Whilst podcasting is being utilized as a teaching tool by some educators in the secondary sector, its use in higher education, and its effectiveness as a learning tool for adults, remains to be established. In our study, a separate group of just under 200 first-level students were given a series of revision podcasts after completing a course in Information and Communications Technology (and prior to their examination). As part of the subscription process, they had to complete an online questionnaire about their experience. The questionnaire utilized a five-point Likert scale comparing their attitudes to lectures, podcasts, notes, textbooks and multimedia e-learning systems. Statistical analysis of the results of the study indicates that students believe that podcasts are more effective revision tools than their textbooks and they are more efficient than their own notes in helping them to learn. They also indicate that they are more receptive to the learning material in the form of a podcast than a traditional lecture or textbook. The study suggests that the use of podcasts as a revision tool has clear benefits as perceived by undergraduate students in terms of the time they take to revise and how much they feel they can learn.

Most people are required and rewarded for solving problems. However, learning to solve problems is too seldom required in formal educational settings, in part, because our understanding of its processes is limited. Instructional-design research and theory has devoted too little attention to the study of problem-solving processes or methods and models for supporting problem-solving learning. In this article, I describe differences among problems in terms of their structuredness, complexity, and domain specificity (abstractness). Then, I briefly describe a variety of individual differences (factors internal to the problem solver) that affect problem solving. Finally, I articulate a typology of problems, each type of which engages different cognitive, affective, and conative processes and therefore necessitates different instructional support. The purpose of this paper is to propose a meta-theory of problem solving in order to initiate dialogue and research rather than offering a definitive answer regarding its processes.", "paper_abstract": "Cognitive Models", "y": "0.6251845218670653", "x": "99"}, {"file_hash": "tracing-the-development-of-teacher-knowledge-in-a-design-seminar-integrating-content-pedagogy-and-technology", "year": "Computers & Education", "id": "dcf04750-6d06-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7", "authos": "b00461644981063178ee0e723c494299d3d14058", "title": "Tracing the development of teacher knowledge in a design seminar: Integrating content, pedagogy and technology", "url": "2007", "area": "0.6153825975400589", "published_in": "Effective technology integration for teaching subject matter requires knowledge not just of content, technology and pedagogy, but also of their relationship to each other.

From this perspective, we describe an approach to the design of learning environments that builds on the educational properties of games, but deeply grounds them within a theory of learning appropriate for an age marked by the power of new technologies. We argue that to understand the future of learning, we have to look beyond schools to the emerging arena of video games. We suggest that video games matter because they present players with simulated worlds: worlds which, if well constructed, are not just about facts or isolated skills, but embody particular social practices. Video games thus make it possible for players to participate in valued communities of practice and as a result develop the ways of thinking that organize those practices.

Ideas, technologies and implications for education by", "url": "2007", "area": "2.1445764026829446", "published_in": "Within 15 years the Web has grown from a group work tool for scientists at CERN into a global information space with more than a billion users. Currently, it is both returning to its roots as a read/write tool and also entering a new, more social and participatory phase. These trends have led to a feeling that the Web is entering a second phasea new, improved Web version 2.0. But how justified is this perception? This TechWatch report was commissioned to investigate the substance behind the hyperbole surrounding Web 2.0 and to report on the implications this may have for the UK Higher and Further Education sector, with a special focus on collection and preservation activities within libraries. The report argues that by separating out the discussion of Web technologies (ongoing Web development overseen by the W3C), from the more recent applications and services (social software), and attempts to understand the manifestations and adoption of these services (the big ideas), decision makers will find it easier to understand and act on the strategic implications of Web 2.0. Indeed, analysing the composition and interplay of these strands provides a useful framework for understanding its significance. The report establishes that Web 2.0 is more than a set of cool and new technologies and services, important though some of these are. It has, at its heart, a set of at least six powerful ideas that are changing the way some people interact. Secondly, it is also important to acknowledge that these ideas are not necessarily the preserve of Web 2.0, but are, in fact, direct or indirect reflections of the power of the network: the strange effects and topologies at the micro and macro level that a billion Internet users produce. This might well be why Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, maintains that Web 2.0 is really just an extension of the original ideals of the Web that does not warrant a special moniker. However, business concerns are increasingly shaping the way in which we are being led to think and potentially act on the Web and this has implications for the control of public and private data. Indeed, Tim OReillys original attempt to articulate the key ideas behind Web 2.0 was focused on a desire to be able to benchmark and therefore identify a set of new, innovative companies that were potentially ripe for investment. The UK HE sector should debate whether this is a long-term issue and maybe delineating Web from Web 2.0 will help us to do that. As with other aspects of university life the library has not escaped considerable discussion about the potential change afforded by the introduction of Web 2.0 and social media. One of the key objectives of the report is to examine some of the work in this area and to tease out some of the key elements of ongoing discussions. For example, the report argues that there needs to be a distinction between concerns around quality of service and user-centred change and the services and applications that are being driven by Web 2.0 ideas. This is particularly important for library collection and preservation activities and some of the key questions for libraries are: is the content produced by Web 2.0 services sufficiently or fundamentally different to that of previous Web content and, in particular, do its characteristics make it harder to collect and preserve? Are there areas where further work is needed by researchers and library specialists? The report examines these questions in the light of the six big ideas as well as the key Web services and applications, in order to review the potential impact of Web 2.0 on library services and preservation activities.

If a game cannot be learned and even mastered at a certain level, it won't get played by enough people, and the company that makes it will go broke. Good learning in games is a capitalist-driven Darwinian process of selection of the fittest. Of course, game designers could have solved their learning problems by making games shorter and easier, by dumbing them down, so to speak. But most gamers don't want short and easy games.
